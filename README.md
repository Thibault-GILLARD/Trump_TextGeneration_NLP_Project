<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

By looking for an intresting dataset to work on, I found a dataset containing all the Rally Speeches of Donald Trump during 2019-2020, so during his second presidential campaign. 
Trump is a controversial person, and I think it can be very funny to be able to generate his speeches, generate speeches for an other context... Create a AI with Trump's """personality"""...

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

### Dataset

The dataset is composed of 35 speeches of Donald Trump, each speech is in a .txt file. The dataset was found on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/christianlillelund/donald-trumps-rallies

Here is an an Exploratory data analysis that I did on the dataset : [EDA](https://github.com/Thibault-GILLARD/Trump_TextGeneration_NLP_Project/blob/master/EDA.ipynb)

### Model
